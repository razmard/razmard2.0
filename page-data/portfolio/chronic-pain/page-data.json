I discovered how we all have some kind of repressed \\nanger inside that we project on people that look or behave a certain \\nway. Imagining how it would look like in the inner worlds of our \\nsubconscious, the effort to draw Chronic Pain was started, just with the\\n idea of unleashing repressed anger.\\nThe giant figure holds an axe in one hand and a burning heart in other, \\nthe axe representing weapons of destruction and the burning heart, the \\npain that fuels the anger to use the weapon. His head is set aflame to \\nrepresent the state of blood frenzy warriors into and can think only \\nabout destruction. The giant represents mankind’s possessive attitude \\ntowards land and how it goes to fight without thinking resembling our \\nprimal fight or flight responses.\\nThe mandril and snake represent unknown dangers, lurking in our \\nsubconscious. We mostly fear the idea of things more than what they \\ntruly are. These two giant creatures represent all the bad attributes we\\n assign to things that we do not know and fear and come to fight as a \\nfirst response. Behind them runs water to represent the subtle nature of\\n these subconscious forces, mostly hiding deep inside us not visible \\nuntil you look deep inside\\nIn Front of them stands a mountain with many watch towers that are set \\naflame. The towers represent mankind’s civilization and advancement \\nwhich is set ablaze in the process of war. Although the giant warrior is\\n fighting the forces of evil, the civilization is already destroyed.\\nIn front of all these a skeleton is leading a dead mermaid horse that is\\n carrying a skull, the leading skeleton is carrying a white flag with a \\nscythe drawn on it.\\nThis image was baffling to myself as well, because I do not know what I \\nam drawing as I am drawing them, and I contemplate the drawing after it \\nis finished. I came to the conclusion that the skull with the blue halo \\nis representing the more subtle forces of subconscious that guide us. \\nAnd the skull with the red halo represents our more material and \\nconscious  side. Although it seems as the red skull is the one that is \\nriding the horse of death and we are starting wars consciously, it is \\nour subconscious nature that is really the one that is leading the horse\\n and has the reigns in its hand.\\nThe sacred lamb, represents the mercy and hope, showing itself in the \\nmidst of chaos and offering a glimpse of hope to the desperate war \\nridden people or victims of  anger in general.\\nThe music on this track is an original riff I had written years ago and \\ndidn’t find a use for. After the animation was done, I immediately \\nthought of putting some music on the riff was what felt natural for it. \",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}]},{\"nodeType\":\"heading-2\",\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Details\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}]},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"The\\n drawing was made in an improvisational manner, after a transcendent \\nexperience of mine seeing Shiva in a state of meditation.The \\ncolor palette is inspired by nature and wants to encapture the \\nrejuvenation of water mixed with the sturdiness with the skies in the \\nmostly blue palette.
